# Habit Tracker Web App (A Project to Learn Typescript)

### Habit Management:

- Create, Edit, and Delete Habits:
  - Each habit will have:
    - Name (e.g., "Exercise")
    - Frequency (e.g., "Twice a week," "Every Monday and Friday")
    - Description (optional)
- TypeScript Practice: Define a Habit interface that includes a frequency field.
- Learning Points: Work with string literals and enums for frequency options, and practice managing optional properties.

### Completion Tracking:

- Users will track their completion based on the specified frequency. For example, if a user sets a habit to be done "Twice a week," they can mark their completion for those days.
- TypeScript Practice: Create a method to validate completion based on the selected frequency.
- Learning Points: Use conditional logic and array manipulation to manage completion states.

### Progress Display:

- Display how many times the user has completed the habit versus how many times it was supposed to be completed.
- TypeScript Practice: Create a function that calculates completion rates based on user input for frequency.
- Learning Points: Use string manipulation and type-safe calculations for displaying progress.

### Local Storage:

- Save habits with their frequencies and completion status, allowing users to return to their data later.
- TypeScript Practice: Ensure data integrity when saving and retrieving from local storage.
- Learning Points: Practice working with JSON and handling nullable types.
